We deduce that there is an integer ∆0 such that for any prime p ̸ |∆0, the images of J1, J2 remain irreducible, and the dimensions of I, J1, J2, J1 + J2 are one, one, one, zero respectively. We also have Z((J1)p) ⊂Z(Ip). Therefore, Z((J1)p) is an Fp-definable irreducible component of Z(Ip). The same holds for Z((J2)p). Since dim(J1+J2)p = 0, these two components are different from each other.",
